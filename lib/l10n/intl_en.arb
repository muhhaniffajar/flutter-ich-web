  "ichDescription": "Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a general term for bleeding inside the skull. It encompasses all types of brain bleeds, including subdural, intraparenchymal, intraventricular, subarachnoid, and epidural hemorrhages. ICH is commonly caused by trauma, high blood pressure, blood vessel abnormalities, or aneurysms. The symptoms of ICH vary depending on the location and severity of the bleed, and can range from headaches and dizziness to loss of consciousness or death. Prompt medical attention is required to manage ICH, and the treatment approach depends on the cause, type, and severity of the hemorrhage.",

  "subduralHemorrhage": "Subdural Hemorrhage",
  "whatIsSubduralHemorrhage": "What is a Subdural Hemorrhage?",
  "subduralDescription": "A subdural hemorrhage (SDH) occurs when blood collects between the dura mater (the outermost protective layer of the brain) and the arachnoid layer. This bleeding often happens after a head injury, such as a fall, car accident, or a hard blow to the head. In older adults or those who frequently consume alcohol, even a minor injury can cause this type of bleeding because the blood vessels around the brain become more fragile. The pooled blood can press on the brain and lead to serious complications if not treated promptly.",
  "subduralLocation": "The bleeding occurs between the dura mater (the outermost brain layer) and the arachnoid layer.",
  "subduralCause1": "Head injuries, such as falls or car accidents, which cause small blood vessels around the brain to rupture.",
  "subduralCause2": "In older adults or heavy alcohol users, even minor injuries can cause subdural bleeding due to brain shrinkage and fragile blood vessels.",
  "subduralCharacteristic1": "Blood spreads over the surface of the brain and follows the brain's shape, appearing convex on imaging scans.",
  "subduralCharacteristic2": "It can occur suddenly (acute), develop slowly (subacute), or persist over weeks to months (chronic).",
  "subduralSymptom1": "Acute SDH: Rapid loss of consciousness, sudden severe headache, and focal neurological deficits like weakness.",
  "subduralSymptom2": "Chronic SDH: Gradual headache, confusion, memory problems, or weakness in the body.",

  "subarachnoidHemorrhage": "Subarachnoid Hemorrhage",
  "whatIsSubarachnoidHemorrhage": "What is a Subarachnoid Hemorrhage?",
  "subarachnoidDescription": "A subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) occurs when bleeding happens in the space between the arachnoid layer and the pia mater, two protective layers surrounding the brain. This space is normally filled with cerebrospinal fluid, which cushions the brain. SAH is often caused by the rupture of an aneurysm (a weak spot in a blood vessel) or other blood vessel abnormalities. The main symptom is a sudden, severe headache, often described as the 'worst headache of your life.' This condition is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment.",
  "subarachnoidLocation": "The bleeding occurs in the subarachnoid space, between the arachnoid layer and the pia mater.",
  "subarachnoidCause1": "Rupture of an aneurysm (a bulging weak spot in a blood vessel).",
  "subarachnoidCause2": "Rupture of an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), a tangle of abnormal blood vessels.",
  "subarachnoidCharacteristic1": "Blood is seen in the subarachnoid space on imaging scans.",
  "subarachnoidCharacteristic2": "It can cause a sudden, severe headache, often described as a 'thunderclap headache.'",
  "subarachnoidSymptom1": "Sudden, severe headache, often described as the worst headache ever experienced.",
  "subarachnoidSymptom2": "Nausea and vomiting.",
  "subarachnoidSymptom3": "Stiff neck (nuchal rigidity).",
  "subarachnoidSymptom4": "Changes in mental status or loss of consciousness.",

  "intraventricularHemorrhage": "Intraventricular Hemorrhage",
  "whatIsIntraventricularHemorrhage": "What is an Intraventricular Hemorrhage?",
  "intraventricularDescription": "An intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) occurs when bleeding happens inside the brain's ventricular system, which consists of fluid-filled spaces that produce and circulate cerebrospinal fluid. This type of bleeding is often caused by conditions like aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), or head trauma. The blood can block the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, leading to increased pressure inside the skull and potential brain damage. IVH is a serious condition that requires urgent medical attention.",
  "intraventricularLocation": "The bleeding occurs inside the brain's ventricular system, including the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles.",
  "intraventricularCause1": "Rupture of an aneurysm.",
  "intraventricularCause2": "Arteriovenous malformation (AVM).",
  "intraventricularCause3": "Head trauma.",
  "intraventricularCause4": "Uncontrolled high blood pressure.",
  "intraventricularCause5": "Blood clotting disorders.",
  "intraventricularCharacteristic1": "Blood accumulates inside the brain's ventricles.",
  "intraventricularCharacteristic2": "It can cause the ventricles to expand and increase intracranial pressure.",
  "intraventricularCharacteristic3": "Classified into grades I to IV based on the extent of bleeding and ventricular enlargement.",
  "intraventricularSymptom1": "Sudden headache.",
  "intraventricularSymptom2": "Nausea and vomiting.",
  "intraventricularSymptom3": "Neurological deficits, such as weakness or difficulty speaking.",
  "intraventricularSymptom4": "Changes in consciousness.",
  "intraventricularSymptom5": "Seizures.",

  "intraparenchymalHemorrhage": "Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage",
  "whatIsIntraparenchymalHemorrhage": "What is an Intraparenchymal Hemorrhage?",
  "intraparenchymalDescription": "An intraparenchymal hemorrhage (IPH) occurs when bleeding happens within the brain tissue itself, usually due to the rupture of small blood vessels. This type of bleeding is often caused by high blood pressure, which weakens the blood vessel walls over time. Other causes include cerebral amyloid angiopathy (a condition where protein builds up in blood vessels, common in older adults) or vascular abnormalities like AVMs. The pooled blood can damage surrounding brain tissue and cause symptoms such as sudden severe headache, weakness, or difficulty speaking. IPH is a serious condition that requires immediate medical care.",
  "intraparenchymalLocation": "The bleeding occurs within the brain tissue, usually in the white matter.",
  "intraparenchymalCause1": "High blood pressure causing small blood vessels to rupture.",
  "intraparenchymalCause2": "Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a condition common in older adults where protein builds up in blood vessels.",
  "intraparenchymalCause3": "Vascular abnormalities like arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) or aneurysms.",
  "intraparenchymalCharacteristic1": "Blood is seen within the brain tissue on imaging scans like CT or MRI.",
  "intraparenchymalCharacteristic2": "It can cause damage to the surrounding brain tissue.",
  "intraparenchymalSymptom1": "Sudden, severe headache, often described as the worst headache ever experienced.",
  "intraparenchymalSymptom2": "Nausea and vomiting.",
  "intraparenchymalSymptom3": "Neurological deficits, such as weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking.",
  "intraparenchymalSymptom4": "Loss of consciousness in severe cases.",

  "epiduralHemorrhage": "Epidural Hemorrhage",
  "whatIsEpiduralHemorrhage": "What is an Epidural Hemorrhage?",
  "epiduralDescription": "An epidural hemorrhage (EDH) occurs when blood collects between the dura mater (the outermost protective layer of the brain) and the skull. This condition is usually caused by a head injury, such as a car accident or a fall, which tears the middle meningeal artery. The pooled blood can press on the brain and cause symptoms like severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and loss of consciousness. Epidural hemorrhage is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment to prevent life-threatening complications.",
  "epiduralLocation": "The bleeding occurs between the dura mater and the skull.",
  "epiduralCause1": "Head trauma, such as car accidents or falls, which tears the middle meningeal artery.",
  "epiduralCause2": "In rare cases, it can occur spontaneously in individuals with certain vascular conditions.",
  "epiduralCharacteristic1": "Blood collects between the dura mater and the skull.",
  "epiduralCharacteristic2": "It is usually caused by a tear in the middle meningeal artery.",
  "epiduralSymptom1": "Severe headache.",
  "epiduralSymptom2": "Nausea and vomiting.",
  "epiduralSymptom3": "Loss of consciousness.",
  "epiduralSymptom4": "Stiff neck.",
